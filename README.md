# Tolerance Analysis
[Tolerance analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerance_analysis) is the general term for activities related to the study of potential accumulated variation in mechanical parts and assemblies.

Tolerance stackups or tolerance stacks are used to describe the problem-solving process in mechanical engineering of calculating the effects of the accumulated variation that is allowed by specified dimensions and tolerances.

### Framework
The prototype build is a progressive web app using Firebase and Polymer Web Components.

 Firebase allows us to connect pre-made view components to data components to build an app that features user authentication, a database backend, offline data availability and the ability to be installed to the home screen of an Android device.

This allows for a full-fidelity, offline-capable progressive web app.

* Used Firebase components to add database backend
* Used Firebase components to add user authentication
* Keeps user data available when the user goes offline
* Deployed app to Firebase hosting
* Made  app installable to the home screen of an Android device

### Dependencies
* Node.js
* Bower
* Firebase CLI

### Contributing
 You'll need a static web server to preview the files in the public directory as you are working on them.

* A text editor and terminal shell
* Node.js version 6 or greater
* A Google account
* (optional) An Android device with the latest version of Chrome
